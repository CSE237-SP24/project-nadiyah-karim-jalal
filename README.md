## Iteration One
*Wednesday March 27th, 2024*

**We were able to implement the following features during this iteration:**
- `deposit` Users can deposit money into an account 
- `withdraw` Users can withdraw money from an account

**We intend to implement the following features by the next iteration(s):**
- Users is able to create multiple accounts whose information is stored/saved
- User should not be able to withdraw and transfer money that they do not have
- User is able to access additional information about their account; specifically what type of account it is and its routing number 

**The following is/are things that we have implemented but do not currently work**
- `script.sh` Our script runs the program but has issues accessing our class in our code

**The following are instructions on how to run the program from the command line**
- We have provided a script (script.sh) that allows users to run our program. You can call this script by using the command ‘./script.sh’. Running this script runs into errors, though, that we plan to address in iteration two.
