- to be continued...
## Iteration Two
*Wednesday, April 10th, 2024*

**We were able to implement the following features during this iteration:**
- `saveAccountData` Users can create multiple accounts whose information is stored/saved
- `getAllAccountData` On start, each user that is saved in the text file is added to a HashMap so users can keep their balance from a previous use of the program
- `processingUserSelection` Users should not be able to withdraw and transfer money that they do not have
- `displayingOptions` Users can perform multiple operations in one session
- `displayingOptions` User can exit the program

**We intend to implement the following features by the next iteration(s):**
- User can access additional information about their account; specifically what type of account it is and its routing number
- User can take out loans and repay loans
- Possible deeper implementation of loans with an interest rate based on time passed 

**To our knowledge** we do not have any features that we have implemented but do not currently work

**The following are instructions on how to run the program from the command line**
- `./script.sh` is the command to input to run our program! It works and should prompt the user and start the program.
