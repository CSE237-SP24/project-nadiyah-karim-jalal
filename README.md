#iteration one

what user stories were completed this iteration?
- users can deposit money into an account 
- users can withdraw money from an account
what user stories do you intend to complete next iteration?
> users will be able to create multiple accounts whose information is stored/saved
> user should not be able to withdraw and transfer money that they do not have
> user is able to access additional information about their account; specifically what type of account it is and it’s routing number 
is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work?
> our script runs the program but has issues accessing our class in our code
what commands are needed to compile and run your code from the command line (or better yet, provide a script that people can use to run your program!)
> we have provided a script (script.sh) that allows users to run our program. You can call this script by using the command ‘./script.sh’. Running this script runs into errors, thought, that we plan to address in iteration two.
